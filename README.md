Scope: 

For this project, I am making a website where people can upload photos of their local wildlife and scenery.  There will be a homepage with an add button and a show button.  The info will be type of animal, date, number, and location.  The add button will allow people to add photos and info.  The show button will allow people to view existing photos and info.  The show page will have links to each post and the post pages will have the info and photos visible.

User Stories:

The user will start at the homepage.  If they click the add button, they will be taken to a page where they can upload photos of wildlife and scenery as well as info such as type of animal, number seen, and location.   Their additions will be added as a new post.  If they click the show button, they will be taken to a page where they can view all the previous photos and info that have been uploaded.

Feasability:

For this project, I am using Upload Care to allow the user to upload photos.  This should be feasible.  I went to the Upload Care website and it said I could use it by adding something to my HTML file.
